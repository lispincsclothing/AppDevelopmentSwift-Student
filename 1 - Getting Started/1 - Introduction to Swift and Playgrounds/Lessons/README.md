* “What's a modern language? It's one that's safe, fast, and expressive. As Apple was designing Swift, those three primary goals were at the core of every decision.”
    * “Some of the features that make Swift a modern language include:
        * “Clean syntax, which makes code readable and easier to work with
        * Optionals, a new way of expressing when a value may not exist
        * Type inference, which speeds up development and allows the compiler to help identify common issues
        * Type safety, which enforces code that's less likely to crash your program
        * Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) for memory management, which automatically handles some of the deeper technical challenges of native programming
        * Tuples and multiple return values, which allow smaller units of code to do more
        * Generics, which help developers write code that can be used in multiple scenarios”
        * “Fast and concise iteration over collections, making Swift a fast language
        * Structs that support methods, extensions, and protocols, which allow Swift to optimize for memory use and speed while providing flexibility for developers
        * Map, filter, reduce, and other functional programming patterns, which simplify code and streamline common actions that previously required multiple lines of code
        * Powerful error handling, which helps the developer write fewer bugs and better handle scenarios that could cause apps to crash or perform unexpectedly”
